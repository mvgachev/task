In order to run the program you need to install an IDE such as Intelij or Eclipse. When you run it a new localhost service will be created on this address
http://localhost:8080/. 

There are three endpoints that can be used on this address: 
1. Get all accounts:
This request gets all the accounts available in the DB. The url looks like this: http://localhost:8080/accounts/all with a GET request
and a Request Body is required with the sortingType:
{
    "sortingType": "LASTNAME"
}
The four different sorting types are: "LASTNAME", "EMAILADDRESS", "FIRSTNAME", "DATEOFBIRHT".

2. Delete an account by id: 
http://localhost:8080/accounts/delete/1 with a DELETE request and the final number must be the id of the account in the database.

3. Edit an account by id:
http://localhost:8080/accounts/edit/1 with a PUT request and the final number must be the id of the account in the database. Here a Request Body is also 
needed similar to this:
    {
        "id": 1,
        "firstName": "test",
        "lastName": "changedLastName",
        "emailAddress": "em.address",
        "dateOfBirth": "2000-01-28"
    }
